# LogRhythmConfigBackup
The "LogRhythm System Monitor" is the agent we use to collect logs from customers. Sometimes the settings in the INI files disappear when we perform agent upgrades. This is not Ok. Customer do not perform backups of these INI files. This small program will perform backups of these INI files, stored on the same server.
